//the Stream API is a powerful set of tools used to process collections of objects.
// A stream is a sequence of objects that supports various methods which can be pipelined to produce the desired result.
//A stream is not a data structure instead it takes input from the Collections, Arrays or I/O channels.
//Streams donâ€™t change the original data structure, they only provide the result as per the pipelined methods.
//if stream consume once you cannot use it again.
//A stream consists of source followed by zero or more intermediate methods combined together (pipelined) and
// a terminal method to process the objects obtained from the source as per the methods described.
//stream is a different view of collections.
